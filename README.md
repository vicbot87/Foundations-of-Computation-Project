 Java Files to simulate an NFA
Program.java simulates e-NFA from STDIn and performs Epsilon closure 
Program1.java simulates NFA from STDIn and then tests Strings from STDIn to determine if the given String is accepted by the given NFA 
NumberList.java is the data structure chosen to hold NFA state transition values
